React with typescript boilerplate

# Instructions to run

-   npm i (with node v12.1 > greater)
-   npm run start
-   Open your favorite browser and go to localhost:3000 !

# Things I would have done better with more time

-   Handling some edge cases (like wrong parameter in the page url, better loading screens and transitions, etc)
-   Better styling. Looks pretty good, but could be better
-   Better separation of concerns in terms of code
-   Some unit tests
